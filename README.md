# double-square
## Number-theoretic software: compute sequences of multiples of prime powers etc

This software is able to find gaps between squarefree, cubefree numbers or similar and is based on an algorithm published by Louis Marmet in [1].

Apart from the standard library, the number-theoretic library [NTL](https://www.shoup.net/ntl/) by Victor Shoup is used.

At the moment (as of 2019-05-15), there are no command line options and the parameters have to be put directly into the source code.

The software is licensed under GPLv3.0.
